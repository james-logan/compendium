# compendium


A book tracking app geared towards the scifi genre. Users can keep track of their progress through books, and record the date on which they finish them. That book with then appear on a timeline of books they've read. 

Upon finishing readers are asked to create book tags in several categories. The hope is to encourage users to create thoughtful and accurate book tags (something which has proven difficult, even for large companies). The app is gamified so that users are rewarded with experience points for completing books and adding tags.
